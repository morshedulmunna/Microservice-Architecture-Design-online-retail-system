#### Microservice Architecture Design in a NodeJS/NestJS Environment:

**Scenario:** You are tasked with designing a microservice architecture for an online retail system. This system should manage various aspects like product catalog, user accounts, orders, and payment processing.

### **Microservices:**

#### 1\. **Product Catalog Service**

- **Database:** MongoDB or a similar NoSQL database for flexible schema and quick retrieval of product information.
- **Functionality:** Manages products, categories, inventory.

#### 2\. **User Account Service**

- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data like user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
- **Functionality:** Handles user accounts, authentication, authorization, and user-related data.

#### 3\. **Order Service**

- **Database:** MongoDB or a SQL database, depending on the complexity of order-related data and need for transactional integrity.
- **Functionality:** Manages orders, handles order creation, updates, and status tracking.

#### 4\. **Payment Processing Service**

- **Database:** May not require a database if it primarily handles payment gateway integration. However, it might store transaction logs in a reliable storage like Elasticsearch.
- **Functionality:** Integrates with payment gateways, processes transactions, logs payment information.

### **Communication between Microservices:**

1. **RESTful APIs or GraphQL:** Each microservice exposes an API for interaction. NestJS provides excellent tools for building RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints, ensuring standardized communication.
2. **Message Broker (Optional):** Implement a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication between services. This ensures loose coupling and better scalability.

### **Security:**

1. **JWT Tokens:** Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization across services. NestJS provides robust authentication mechanisms.
2. **HTTPS:** Ensure secure communication between microservices using HTTPS to prevent data breaches.

# **Order Creation API Documentation**

### **Endpoint**

- **URL**: [`http://localhost:3000/order/create`](http://localhost:3000/order/create)
- **Method**: `POST`

### **Request Body**

- **Format**: JSON
- **Fields**:
  - `user_id` (string)
  - `orderId` (string)
  - `products` (array of strings)
  - `payment` (boolean)

#### Example Request Body

```javascript
{
  "user_id": "dsfgjrgj123",
  "orderId": "23fsdfr%$243",
  "products": ["234234","2352df3", "dgsd@$@$234"],
  "payment": true
}
```

### **Error Handling**

- **Response Code**: `400 Bad Request`
- **Response Body**:

```javascript
{
  "message": [
    "user_id must be a string",
    "orderId must be a string",
    "products must be an array",
    "payment must be a boolean value"
  ],
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```

### **Successful Response**

- **Response Format**: JSON Array
- **Example Response**:

```javascript
[
  {
    user_id: 'dsfgjrgj123',
    orderId: '23fsdfr%$243',
    products: ['234234', '2352df3', 'dgsd@$@$234'],
    payment: true,
  },
  {
    user_id: 'dsfgjrgj123',
    orderId: '23fsdfr%$243',
    products: ['234234', '2352df3', 'dgsd@$@$234'],
    payment: true,
  },
];
```
